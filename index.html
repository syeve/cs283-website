    <p><i>
      A no-bake, frozen cake made from ice cream sandwiches
      and a couple of other tasty ingredients, this is an Ice Cream Sandwich Cake!
      This recipe takes a fraction of the time that a homemade ice cream cake
      would take and yet it still tastes absolutely amazing.
      Dress it up with rosettes of cool whip, chocolate syrup, and peanuts,
      or keep it simple, either way, youâ€™ll have a killer cake perfect for
      birthdays, summer BBQâ€™s or just because! </i></p>

    <h2 id = "ingredients"> Main Ingredients </h2>
    <p> Gather up these 6 ingredients and a 9Ã—9 baking dish to get started.
      Hereâ€™s what youâ€™ll need to make an Ice Cream Sandwich Cake: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> <b> Ice Cream Sandwiches</b>:
      the beauty of this recipe is you can adapt it easily into any flavors you like!
      There are neopolitan, cookies and cream, all chocolate and all vanilla
      ice cream sandwiches available. I used the vanilla flavor! </li>
      <li> <b> Ice Cream</b>:
      I used Moose Tracks but feel free to use another flavor of ice cream! </li>
      <li> <b> Peanut Butter</b>:
      this is optional, especially if youâ€™re allergic! This is layered inbetween
      the ice cream sandwiches and adds such a yummy nutty flavor. </li>
      <li> <b> Cool Whip</b>:
      this tops off the whole thing. I also make this cake pretty by piping
      rossettes on top! </li>
      <li> <b> Chocolate Syrup</b>:
      this adds a yummy drizzle to the top.
      Feel free to use magic chocolate shell instead. </li>
      <li> <b> Peanuts</b>:
      once again, optional but super yummy. You can replace this with chocolate chips,
      mini M&Mâ€™s, crushed Oreos or sprinkles. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id = "howto"> How to Make Ice Cream Sandwich Cake </h2>
    <p> For full details on how to make this Ice Cream Sandwich Cake,
      see the recipe card down below ðŸ™‚ </p>
    <ol>
      <li> <b> Prep Pan </b>: Line a 9Ã—9 or 8Ã—8 square pan with foil. </li>
      <li> <b> Layer Ingredients </b>: Open 6 ice cream sandwiches and fit them
        into the bottom of the pan, cutting where necessary. </li>
        <ul>
          <li> Itâ€™s ok if they donâ€™t fit perfectly. </li>
          <li> Any holes you can fill with ice cream. </li>
          <li> Spread ice cream in an even layer across the top of the ice cream sandwiches. </li>
          <li> Be sure to press any additional ice cream into any holes not filled by ice cream sandwiches. </li>
          <li> Drizzle the top of the ice cream with peanut butter and top with the remaining ice cream sandwiches. </li>
          <li> Fill any gaps with extra ice cream. </li>
        </ul>
      <li> <b> Freeze</b>: Cover and freeze for at least 3 hours to solidify. </li>
      <li> <b> Decorate!</b>: Remove from pan using foil and unwrap. Place onto serving platter.
        Spread the exterior of the cake with Cool Whip. Drizzle the top with chocolate sauce and
        sprinkle with chopped peanuts. Use any additional cool whip in a piping bag fitted
        with a large star tip (I used Wilton 1M). Add rosettes to the top of the cake and
        sprinkle with more chopped peanuts.
        Store in the freezer until ready to serve. Cut into 16 even pieces and serve. </li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id = "store"> How to Store an Ice Cream Sandwich Cake </h2>
    <p> Another huge perk of this Ice Cream Sandwich Cake is that it is so easy to store!
      Whether you plan to make this ahead of time or are just saving leftovers,
      Iâ€™ve got you covered. </p>
    <h3> Make-Ahead </h3>
    <p> If youâ€™re making this recipe ahead of time, Iâ€™d suggest storing it before decorating the top.
      You can do this for up to a week! Then when youâ€™re ready to serve, remove the cake from the baking dish,
      and decorate with cool whip and toppings.</p>
    <h3> Saving Leftovers </h3>
    <p> Storing after decorating can be a little more difficult but itâ€™s not impossible!
      Skip the rosettes or simply scrape them off if youâ€™re saving leftovers.
      Return to a freshly lined baking dish and cover the top with plastic wrap then foil.
      Freeze for up to two weeks. The second method wonâ€™t be as pretty but youâ€™ll be able
      to enjoy the leftovers of this treat after your big event is over.</p>
    <p> Once again, feel free to change up this recipe to suit your wants!
      Go make this Ice Cream Sandwich Cake before summer is over ðŸ™‚ </p>
